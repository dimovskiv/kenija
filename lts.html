           <p> At Choice integrated Academy;  for computer science, each course is comprised of three terms (1 year). Also, each stage is comprised of three courses (3 years). After completing one stage, a student advances to the next stage. This learning path enables students to learn each course in-depth and become true problem-solvers in computer science.

            The Science with Experiments course content is based on the UK’s science curriculum. Students will learn the principles of science that occur in their daily lives by doing the experiments hands-on. This science course enables students to visually and logically understand science for effective learning. </p>
